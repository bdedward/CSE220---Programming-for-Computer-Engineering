The 'tail' command displays the last 10 lines of a file.
An option can be used to change 10 to some other number.
The entire file is displayed if the number of lines to
print is less than the total number of lines in the file.

Note:  There is a 'head' command displays the first 10 lines
of a file.  An option can be used to change 10 to some other
number.

Some notes about the Unix 'tail' command that are
not part of this assignment.

Multiple file names can be specified on the 'tail' command
line.  If no file names are given, then 'tail' gets its input
from the standard input stream.

A -f option can be used that displays lines as they are
written to a file.

Example:  tail -f log

Prints the first 10 lines in file log, but the command
continues to run and will display lines as they are
appended to file log.
